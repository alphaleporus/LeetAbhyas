## 📦 Repo Overview

This repository tracks my LeetCode progress — every accepted submission is automatically pulled using a custom Python bot and GitHub Actions.

Each submission is saved as:

- A code file (Java)
- A matching Markdown file (notes, explanation, ideas)
- Organised by problem ID and slug

Example:
auto_sync_bot/submissions/
└── 1-two-sum/
├── 1-two-sum.java
└── 1-two-sum.md
